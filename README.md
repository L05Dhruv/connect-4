# Connect 4
### Python

With this challenge, you will learn how to build the classic connect four game. This project utilizes the numpy, math, pygame and sys Python modules.

This project is great if you have already built some smaller beginner Python projects.

## Objectives

Achieve a functioning connect 4 game using python.
The game board is provided for you - using `pygame`, which stands for "Python Game Development". Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python libraries designed for creating video games and multimedia applications.

Feel free to edit the board and make it your own.

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Run the following command:

Windows:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

MacOS/Linux:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Take a look at `board.py` and run this file to get an idea of how the game will look in the separate window display. Read the [PYGAME DOCUMENTATION](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) for help dealing with pygame

4. Implement your game logic:
- You can do this in a separate file (`game.py`) or within the same file as the board.
